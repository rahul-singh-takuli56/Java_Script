# DOM: 
- Dom stands for Document Object Model. 
- It is used to represent the document in the form of tree of objects.
- ```Objects``` All the element and attributes and other components of an HTML or XML are known as Objects;
- This tree of objects can be in the form of HTML or XML.
- Dom helps us to manipulate the content, style, attributes, or properties of content of document.
- We can dynamically change interface in real time with the help of DOM.
- ```Tree Structure``` The DOM represents the document as a tree structure, where each node in the tree corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text.
- ```Objects and Properties```  Each node in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and the properties of these objects can be manipulated using JavaScript. For example, you can change the content of an HTML element, modify its attributes, or add and remove elements from the document.
- ``` Document Object ```  The top-level object in the DOM is usually referred to as the "document" object. It represents the entire HTML or XML document and provides methods and properties for interacting with the document.
