```These properties and methods are commonly used in JavaScript to manipulate the content and attributes of HTML elements on a web page.```
- InnerHTML: returns all html nodes 
- TextContent : returns all text content
- innerText : gives the text in the selected node
- querySelector:
- querySelectorAll:
- getAttribute:
- setAttribute:

- ```innerHTML```  The innerHTML property is used to get or set the HTML content within an element. When used to get the content, it returns a string representing the HTML content of the element, including any nested elements.

- ```textContent``` The textContent property is used to get or set the text content of an element. It returns the text content of all elements inside the specified element, without including any HTML tags.

- ```innerText``` Similar to textContent, the innerText property is used to get or set the text content of an element. However, there are some differences in how white spaces and styling are handled.

- ```querySelector``` The querySelector method is used to select the first element that matches a specified CSS selector within the document. It returns null if no matching element is found.

- ```querySelectorAll``` Similar to querySelector, querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector and returns them as a static NodeList.

- ```setAttribute``` The setAttribute method is used to set the value of a specified attribute on an element. If the attribute doesn't exist, it will be created.
